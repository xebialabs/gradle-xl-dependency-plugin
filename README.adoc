= Gradle XebiaLabs Dependency Management Plugin
:plugin_version: 1.0.0
:source-highlighter: pygments

This is the Gradle XebiaLabs Dependency Management plugin. When applied to your Gradle project it will be possible to omit version numbers from the specified dependencies, and have them come from imported dependency specification files.

== How to apply
This plugin is not published (_yet_) to Gradle Plugin Central. It is only available from our Nexus. Please apply the plugin using the following code in the `rootProject` _build.gradle_ file.

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.rootProject build.gradle
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
        url "${nexusBaseUrl}/repositories/releases"
        credentials {
            username nexusUserName
            password nexusPassword
        }
    }
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath "gradle.plugin.com.xebialabs:gradle-xl-dependency-plugin:{plugin_version}"
  }

  apply plugin: 'com.xebialabs.dependency'
}

== Plugins contained

=== The 'com.xebialabs.dependency.base' plugin
This plugin is the _base_ plugin that doesn't force any opinions on the project. Note this plugin can _only_ be applied on the `rootProject`

==== What it does
When applied the plugin does the following:

- An extension named `dependencyManagement` is added to the `rootProject`
- The `resolutionStrategy` of `allProjects.configurations` is set to resolve versions against this plugin

=== The 'com.xebialabs.dependency' plugin
This plugin builds on top of the `com.xebialabs.dependency.base` plugin, and adds the following opinions on top of the `xebialabs.dependency.base` plugin:

1. It will take any overridden versions defined on the `rootProject` (See: <<Version keys as project properties>>)
2. It will load a `${rootProject.projectDir}/gradle/dependencies.conf` file which is required to be present

== How it works
Using the `dependencyManagement` extension it is possible to import configuration files containing dependency information.

- You can either import a file local to the project
- You can import a maven dependency using the shortform (`<group_id>:<artifact_id>:<version>`) dependency notation. In this case the plugin will attempt to find the `<artifact_id>.conf` file located at that location in the maven repository.

For example:

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.build.gradle example
----
apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'xebialabs.dependency'

dependencyManagement {
  importConf rootProject.file("path/to/hocon.conf")
  importConf "com.xebialabs.xl-platform:xl-reference:${xlPlatformVersion}"
}

repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  compile "org.apache.pekko:pekko-actor_$scalaVersion"
  testCompile "junit:junit"
}
----


== The file format
The plugin reads the dependency management specification from a https://github.com/typesafehub/config[HOCON] file. Substitutions are allowed inside one file, not across multiple files. The format of the HOCON file should be the following:

[source,subs='verbatim,attributes']
.reference.conf
----
dependencyManagement {
  versions {
    junitVersion: "4.12"
    scalaVersion: "2.11"
    akkaVersion: "2.3.9"
  }
  dependencies: [
    "junit:junit:$junitVersion"
    {
      group: "com.typesafe.akka"
      version: "$akkaVersion"
      artifacts: [
        "akka-actor_$scalaVersion"
        "akka-testkit_$scalaVersion"
      ]
    }
  ]
  rewrites {
    "jdom:jdom": "org.jdom:jdom"
  }
  blacklist: [
    "com.google.collections:google-collections"
  ]
}
----

As is shown, there are 4 sections in the conf file.

=== The 'versions' section
The `versions` section allows you to refer to a version number using a name. In this way you can (potentially) reuse a single version number for different related artifacts. It is a map of key-value pairs.

=== The 'dependencies' section
The `dependencies` section is a list of dependencies in either:

- `<group_id>:<artifact_id>:<version>` notation
- a block containing a group of similar artifacts sharing a `group_id` and `version`

The placeholders in the strings will be replaced with the data coming from the `versions` section.
Each matching dependency in each configuration of each project will be forced to use the version defined in this block.

=== The 'rewrites' section
The `rewrites` section contains group:artifact pairs that should be rewritten to a different group:artifact combination. This allows to map moved modules onto their new location.

=== The 'blacklist' section
The `blacklist` section contains `group` or `group:artifact` entries. All entries listed here will be blacklisted from all configurations of all projects.

== Advanced use

=== Version keys as project properties
It is possible to define named versions using project properties. The project property should be of the format: `dependencyManagement.versions.<name>` in order to be picked up. See for instance the following example:

[source]
.reference.conf
----
dependencyManagement {
  versions {
    junitVersion: "4.12"
  }
  dependencies: [
    "junit:junit:$junitVersion"
  ]
}
----

[source]
.build.gradle
----
apply plugin: 'com.xebialabs.dependency.base'
apply plugin: 'java'

dependencyManagement {
  supplier com.xebialabs.gradle.dependency.supplier.ProjectSupplier(project)
  importConf project.file('reference.conf')
}

dependencies {
  testCompile 'junit:junit'
}
----

If you would launch gradle now using the following command line: `gradle build -PdependencyManagement.versions.junitVersion=4.11`, it would force junit to the `4.11` version instead of the 4.12 specified in the `reference.conf` file.

The `com.xebialabs.dependency` plugin takes care of this automatically.

=== Adding your own supplier
It is possible to add your own `DependencyManagementSupplier` that will supply the dependency management information to the plugin. You can do so by extending the `com.xebialabs.gradle.dependency.supplier.DependencyManagementSupplier`.

You can add your own supplier to your build.gradle file using the following snippet:

[source]
.build.gradle
----
apply plugin: 'com.xebialabs.dependency.base'

dependencyManagement {
  supplier <your class>
}
----
